# WarmStorageChain

WarmStorageChain is an open-source project that leverages blockchain technology to implement a heating Layer 2 solution for the Filecoin storage network, enhancing data reliability and efficiency.

## Introduction

WarmStorageChain is designed to address the common challenges faced by decentralized storage systems, such as latency and data accessibility. By introducing a heating Layer 2 solution, WarmStorageChain ensures that data stored on the Filecoin network is kept in a 'warm' state, meaning it is quickly retrievable and consistently performant. The project integrates Cosmos SDK for blockchain interoperability and Filecoin for decentralized file storage.

## Features

- **Heating Layer 2**: Implements a Layer 2 solution to maintain Filecoin-stored data in an optimal state for quick access and reliability.
- **Decentralized File Storage**: Leverages Filecoin for decentralized, secure, and scalable file storage.
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Reduces latency and improves data retrieval times through an innovative heating mechanism.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures seamless interaction between different blockchain networks within the Cosmos ecosystem.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/) 
- [Cosmos Ignite CLI](https://docs.ignite.com/guide/install)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WarmStorageChain.git
    cd WarmStorageChain
    ```

3. Initialize the blockchain:

    ```bash
    cd warmstoragechain
    ignite chain serve
    ```

### Usage

To use WarmStorageChain, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Filecoin Node**: Install and configure your Filecoin node. Follow the [Filecoin documentation](https://docs.filecoin.io/get-started/) for setup instructions.
2. **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Deploy the smart contracts to your preferred Cosmos-based blockchain network.
3. **Initialize Heating Layer 2**: Configure and initialize the heating Layer 2 through the provided interface.
4. **Integrate with Cosmos Hub**: Ensure your setup is properly integrated with the Cosmos Hub for enhanced interoperability.

## Example

Here is a basic example of how to initialize the heating Layer 2:
